Thanks to main author (A1win) for making this epic map!

Objectives:
- For the Quad Hunters, kill the Quad Hog.
- For the Quad Hog, kill the Quad Hunters.

Tips:
- Quad Hog gains Quad Damage and his health and armor will regenerate while holding the flag.
- Quad Hog's health regeneration is percentual and varies between 5% and 10% depending on the number of players on the server.
- The Quad Hog can stay alive until 60 seconds without any kill.
